# Upsolve: Experimental Knowledge Management System for Competitive Programming. 

## 1. Introduction
- [Competitive Programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) have different systems for intensive studying before programming competitions, but there has never been a personalized system, which also happens to be minimalistic, specifically targeting this stage of preparation. Most programmers solve many problems on drastically different platforms but have no system for managing, reviewing, or learning from them after participating in contests.

### 1.1. Spaced Repetition + Active Recall
- Top students in any field have some knowledge management system to keep track of their consumption of new topics. Two of the most well-studied learning methods that have been shown to enhance knowledge retention are "Spaced Repetition" and "Active Recall," supported by powerful management systems such as flashcards, jotted notes, and dynamic note-taking tools (Anki, Notion, Obsidian, etc.).
- When used correctly in combination, not only are students able to memorize a large quantity of concepts before exams, but also be able to retain these concepts long-term for future use.

### 1.2. Application in Competitive Programming
- Computing Systems are complex, while tech stacks keep expanding exponentially. It is crucial for all programmers to adhere to a disciplinary system to acquire the right knowledge for their specific role in tech. In Competitive Programming, it is crucial for contestants to have complex algorithms at hand to solve a wide range of programming problems, and to have experience implementing and modifying them to satisfy problem constraints. Unlike the typical software development process, competitive programming is fast-paced. Programming competitions like the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global/) require contestants to implement many data structures and algorithms in under an hour, solving dozens of problems within hours or less. Essentially, we want a minimalist system much like Anki, but with features tailored to memorizing competitive programming problems. 

## 2. Features of Algobase
- The user is able to CREATE a card, which contains a problem statement, and a designated code editor for implementation with syntax highlighting.
  - Assign a difficulty level to each card
- The user is able to STUDY a collection of cards. The platform displays a stored problem statement in an empty code editor, prioritizing the difficulty level. The user inputs the code implementation and compares it with the stored implementation. After that, the difficulty will be adjusted.
