# Algobase: Experimental knowledge management system for Competitive Programming.

## 1. Introduction
- [Competitive Programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) have different systems for intensive studying before programming competitions, but there has never been a personalized system, which also happens to be minimalistic, specifically targetting this stage of preparation. Most programmers upsolve many problems on drastically different platforms, but have no system of managing, reviewing, and learning them after participating in contests.

### 1.1. Spaced Repetition + Active Recall
- The most successful students in any field have some knowledge management system to keep track of their consumption of new topics.
